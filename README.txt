Other Project Notes:
  - Completed the project in Udacity workspace, and tested on the GPU enabled Udacity desktop simulator.
  - Changed some parameters values from ideal/recommended to reduce latency/ improve performance on the simulator, e.g. lookahead to 100 points, waypoint update rate to 25Hz.
  - The car is able to complete laps on the track, driving smooth trajectories and staying inside the lane, with stops for traffic lights.
